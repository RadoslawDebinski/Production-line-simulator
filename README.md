# Production-line-simulator

The application was created to simulate the dispatching station of the "production line". The program performs diagnostics of the supervised process, which is the handling of boxes moving on the line. The simulation parameters depend on the data read from the user's device: GPU temperature [Â°C], CPU consumption [%], GPU memory used [10*GB], RAM consumption [%], as well as on the parameters of the production line, its speed, which is regulated by the user, and the number of boxes on it.

The application verifies if limits of process's parameters was exceeded and informs the user about this fact by video signals. Parameters are set by sliders. In addition, the application contains a login window that allows you to enter the operator's ID, as well as check his consciousness every specified time. If the operator does not show adequate reactions within the time intervals, the process will be paused and the user will be logged out.
